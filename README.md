### Why This Line Thrills Me

This line is incredibly powerful because it encapsulates the core message of the series: that individuals with autism, or any other perceived limitations, can achieve greatness. Woo Young-woo's declaration is a bold assertion of her abilities and potential, challenging societal stereotypes and inspiring viewers to look beyond labels. It highlights her determination and confidence, making it an important moment in the series that resonates deeply with audiences.
